# Service

## Design Considerations

- `Mysql`
  - as we are storing service's name, version and description only, it would be easy to maintain in relational database.
- `GIN`
  - performant, we renowned in opensource community, easy to use and battle tested at my end. 
- `testcontainers-go`
  - `Testcontainers-Go` automates container lifecycle management for integration testing, enabling effortless creation of isolated environments for database testing without manual setup or teardown.
  - It ensures consistency across testing environments, enhances test reproducibility, and enables efficient debugging by closely mirroring production setups
- `GORM`
  - GORM simplifies database operations by allowing developers to interact with the database using Go structures and methods rather than writing raw SQL queries.
  - GORM supports soft deletes, where records are not actually removed from the database but are marked as deleted, allowing for easy recovery and audit.


### Data Model
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |:--------| :--- |
| id | bigint unsigned | NO | PRI | null    | auto\_increment |
| created\_at | datetime\(3\) | YES |  | null    |  |
| updated\_at | datetime\(3\) | YES |  | null    |  |
| deleted\_at | datetime\(3\) | YES |  | null    |  |
| name | varchar\(50\) | YES |  | null    |  |
| description | longtext | YES |  | null    |  |
| version | int | YES |  | 1       |  |
| is\_active | tinyint\(1\) | YES |  | 1       |  |
| tags | varchar\(255\) | YES |  | null    |  |




## Assumptions
- The service `Name` is not unique.
- `Version` is an `int`, e.g., `1`, `9`.
- The service version is server-side driven.
- The first version of the service will always be `1`.
- The `Create service` call will be used to create the first version. For creating a new version, use `PATCH /api/v1/services/{name}/{version}`.
- We use soft deletion in the DB.
- We provided a config file and environment variable support so that it can be hosted on both containerized and non-containerized environments.
- The service name's maximum length is 50 characters.
- We haven't put any limit on service versions.

## Essential Add-ons for Production Readiness.
- File-based MySQL migrations.
- Added `,` separated tags in the model to fine-tune searching.
- Integration with `swaggo/swag` to generate automated swagger documentation from comments.
- Added GIN recovery middleware to recover from unintended panic errors.
- Integrated `Viper` for Config support. (file/env vars)
- Implemented service draining period for graceful shutdowns, the default is `30` seconds. (`The intention is to tackle spot interruptions in the cloud.`)
- Health check points on `/healthcheck` along with `/liveness` and `/readiness`.
- GORM allows developers to interact with the database using Go structures and methods rather than writing raw SQL queries.
- Dockerfile
  - Dependency Caching
  - Multi-stage Build
  - Minimal Base Image (`gcr.io/distroless/static-debian11`)
  - Compiling the Go binary statically (CGO_ENABLED=0) ensures that the application does not depend on any shared libraries, making it more portable and easier to run in different environments.
  
## Integration Tests
Currently, there is one test in `main_test.go`. This file can be extended for more test cases.

## Trade-offs
- haven't put limit on versions.
- Table level indexing is yet to be implemented. 

## Pending / future scope.
- authentication/authorization on the API
