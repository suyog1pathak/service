# -w: This flag is used to disable DWARF generation. DWARF (Debugging With Attributed Record Formats) is a debugging format that contains information
# for debugging the binary.
# -s: This flag is used to strip the symbol table. The symbol table contains information about symbols (functions, variables, etc.) in the binary.
# Stripping the symbol table makes it harder to debug or reverse-engineer the binary but also reduces the binary's size.
